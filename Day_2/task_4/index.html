    <h1>Stephen Hawking</h1>
    <p>
      Stephen William Hawking (8 January 1942 – 14 March 2018) was an English
      theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author who, at the time of his
      death, was director of research at the Centre for Theoretical Cosmology at
      the University of Cambridge.

    <h2>Stephen William Hawking</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>1942 - </strong>Hawking was born on 8 January 1942 in Oxford to
        Frank and Isobel Eileen Hawking.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1959 - </strong>Hawking began his university education at
        University College, Oxford in October 1959 at the age of 17.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1968 - </strong>Their joint essay was the runner-up in the 1968
        Gravity Research Foundation competition.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1970 - </strong>In 1970, Hawking postulated what became known as
        the second law of black hole dynamics, that the event horizon of a black
        hole can never get smaller.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1973 - </strong>Beginning in 1973, Hawking moved into the study
        of quantum gravity and quantum mechanics."
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1975 - </strong>Hawking returned to Cambridge in 1975 to a more
        academically senior post, as reader in gravitational physics.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1979 - </strong>In 1979, Hawking was elected Lucasian Professor
        of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>1990–2000 - </strong>Hawking pursued his work in physics: in
        1993 he co-edited a book on Euclidean quantum gravity with Gary Gibbons
        and published a collected edition of his own articles on black holes and
        the Big Bang. In 1994, at Cambridge's Newton Institute, Hawking and
        Penrose delivered a series of six lectures that were published in 1996
        as "The Nature of Space and Time".
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>2000–2018 - </strong>By 2003, consensus among physicists was
        growing that Hawking was wrong about the loss of information in a black
        hole.In a 2004 lecture in Dublin, he conceded his 1997 bet with
        Preskill, but described his own, somewhat controversial solution to the
        information paradox problem, involving the possibility that black holes
        have more than one topology. In the 2005 paper he published on the
        subject, he argued that the information paradox was explained by
        examining all the alternative histories of universes, with the
        information loss in those with black holes being cancelled out by those
        without such loss.In January 2014, he called the alleged loss of
        information in black holes his "biggest blunder".
      </li>

      <br />
      <li>
        <strong>2018 - </strong>Hawking's final paper – A smooth exit from
        eternal inflation? – was posthumously published in the Journal of High
        Energy Physics on 27 April 2018.
